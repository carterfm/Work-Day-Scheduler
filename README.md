# <Work-Day-Scheduler>
A simple calendar app designed to let a keep track of their workday schedule. The header displays the current date, and the body displays the hours of the workday, with text areas color-coded based on whether their corresponding hour is in the past, present, or future. Users can type up agenda items in the text areas and save them to local storage by pressing the save button at the end of a time block.
